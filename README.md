# SEIR_finalproject_2025 🌍 #
This repository contains the R code and required data files for my final project for the course Spatial Ecology in R at Unibo. 

## Introduction 📚 ##
This is the code for my final project. Satellite imagery is used to assess damage caused by forest fires. 
Some details: 
+ Location: 'Deurnse Peel', which is a Natura2000 site near Eindhoven, Brabant, the Netherlands.
+ Deurnse Peel consists of peatlands, swamps, heaths, forsested areas and scrubs. 
+ The forest fires happened between April 20 and June 16, 2020, and on August 31, 2022.
+ The first fire damaged 710 hectares; the second fire damaged 41 hectares. 
+ The exact geometry of the area of interest is: [[[5.839004,51.384951],[5.839004,51.453853],[5.944748,51.453853],[5.944748,51.384951],[5.839004,51.384951]]]}

## Research questions ❓
The research questions are as follows: 
+ What was the size and spatial distribution of the damage on vegetation in Deurnse Peel after the forest fires of 2020? 
+ What was the size and spatial distribution of the damage on vegetation in Deurnse Peel after the forest fire of 2022? 
+ To what extent has the vegetation recovered four years after the first fire?
